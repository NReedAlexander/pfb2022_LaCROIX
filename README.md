## Final Presentation

### What was our original vision?

A planet generating script with randomly generated output based on user input.

How did we work backward from the final vision?

We started with the pygame display screen and the user input 'sliders' whilesimultaneously working on independent scripts that would take in the user input and randomly generate different features of the map. Finally, all features are used to determine the 'biome' color and these values are plotted on the map.

What type of data structures store our data?

A: arrays and dataframes

How will our scripts communicate with one another?

A: Through the use of a 'mainscript' which imports external scripts and functions.

How small is too small of a data structure to test with?

A: This depends on what is being tested. Regardless of size, it is importantthat you are testing with a compatible data structure.

How do we maintain consistency?

A: Communicate as frequently as possible!! 'Knees-in-meetings' are an essential part of successful projects!!

### What were the main 3 challenges?

1.  
2. 
3. 

### What did each person learn?

### Other random things

1. Arrays vs dataframes
2. Scaling factors
3. Testing versus implementation
4. What does the user see versus what we see?
5. What things do we care about the user seeing versus what we see behind the scenes?
